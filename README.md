# Introduction (Team, Project Description)
The following project examines a projected venture that respective colleges may utilize to ensure further safety of staff and students. With the emergence of COVID-19 food delivery services have become more popular than ever as many restaurants have been forced to close the dining room portion of their business. These restaurants have decided to employee more of an online only model in which customers have two options to either come in and pick up the food or get it delivered. With most restaurants do not have a dedicated delivery service the only options for many college students it to use a service like UberEats or GrubHub. This has caused some concern amongst the college community about the further potential spread of COVID. This is where Crave comes in as they provide another alternative. Crave is a service just like UberEats and GrubHub except the drivers are fellow students and staff thus you know exactly who your food is coming from and no longer have to be concerned that some stranger is bringing you your food. 

Our group has four members which are currently working on and actively developing the database. We are a group of catawba college students looking to help fix the problem of food delivery safety on campus. Our names are Matthew Baily, Chase Barber, Chris Basinger, and Sam Rufer.
