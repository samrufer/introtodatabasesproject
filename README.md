# Introduction (Team, Project Description)

The following project examines a projected venture that respective colleges may utilize to ensure further safety of staff and students. With the emergence of COVID-19 food delivery services have become more popular than ever as many restaurants have been forced to close the dining room portion of their business. These restaurants have decided to employee more of an online only model in which customers have two options. They can either come in and pick up the food or get it delivered. However, most restaurants do not have a dedicated delivery service. Thus the only remaining option for many college students is to use a service like UberEats or GrubHub. This has caused some concern amongst the college community about the further potential spread of COVID. This is where Crave comes in as they provide another alternative. Crave is a service just like UberEats and GrubHub except the drivers are fellow students and staff thus you know exactly who your food is coming from and no longer have to be concerned that some stranger is bringing you your food. 

Our group has four members which are currently working on and actively developing the database. We are a group of catawba college students looking to help fix the problem of food delivery safety on campus. Our names are Matthew Baily, Chase Barber, Chris Basinger, and Sam Rufer.

# Use Case for Rating System

# Business Rules 

The system is fairly straight forward and supports four different user roles. The first is the student. The student has the ability to place orders. They have a variety of options to choose from and can select any of the supported restaurants they desire. The second user role is that of the driver. The driver has the ability to view active orders and select them if they so choose. The driverâ€™s role is to act as the intermediate party between the student and the restaurant. The next user role is the restaurant. The restaurant provides the food for sale and gives the students options to choose from as far as what they are able to eat. Last, we have the admin role which keeps watch over the entire rating system to ensure all parties are holding up there end of the transaction. 

## Rating System Rules

The rating system is absolutely essential for the overall business to becomes successful as there needs to be something holding each party responsible. The student has the largest impact on the system as what they say really determines the overall success. Each student upon completion of receiving the order has the ability to grade both the food quality as well as the efficiency of the driver. This will be fairly straight forward as they will give a standard 1-5 rating on how each party performed. In addition, they will have the ability to leave a review of both the driver and the restaurant which will allow future students to see how past transactions with various restaurants and drivers have gone. The restaurants and drivers will also be able to read these reviews which will allow them to see what the market is saying and make changes if needed. The last role that has access to this data is the admin. The admin plays a crucial role in ensuring that transactions consistently run smoothly. Thus, admin will keep a close eye on all reviews and will remove those parties that are consistently not meeting expectations.
